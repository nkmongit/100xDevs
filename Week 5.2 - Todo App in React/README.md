# WEEK 5.2 - FULL STACK TODO

In this we are going to build a full stack todo application using ExpressJS,
NodeJS, ReactJS and MongoDB.

This project contains a simple TODO application. It has the following features

- A user can sign up.
- A user can sign in.
- A user can create a todo.
- A user can see their existing todo.
- A user can mark a todo as done.

For now we are focusing on building this workflow.

- Anyone can create a todo.
- Anyone can see their existing todo.
- A user can mark a todo as done.
