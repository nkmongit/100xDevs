`What is Git?`

- Free and open source version control system.

`What is Version Control System?`

- A system that keeps track of our files or projects.
- It allows you to revert selected files to a previous state, `revert` the entire project to a previous state, `compare changes` over time, see who last modified something so that we can know what might be causing a problem, or `what` is this issue, who made it, and `when` with the details.

`There are two types of VCS`

1. Centralized
   - That means there's a centralized server which is being actually used to access the code and at the same time make any changes in the code.
   - Helps you backup, track and synchronize files.
   - `Example` : Subversion & Team Foundation Server.
   - Problem with these VCS are, if Centralized Server is not available everthing's gonna go down, and no one would be able to collaborate on the project.
2. Distributed
   - In this type of VCS everyone who is working on the project has all the codebase locally in their device, you are not just checking out the code you will be mirroring the full repository.
   - So even if the server goes out you can use any of the clients, people participating in the
     collaboration group to restore the project.
   - Another advantage servers need not to be online (available all the time), or you don't have to be online.
   - `Example` : Git & Mercury.
